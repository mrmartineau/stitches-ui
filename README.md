# Stitches UI

## A minimal implementation of [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com) using [Stitches](https://stitches.dev)

As a long-time fan of [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com) I wanted to see how I might replicate the same functionality using [Stitches](https://stitches.dev). I found that I not only could replicate the functionality, but also create a more robust design-system whilst having the flexibility of Theme UI's `sx` prop, but with Stitches' `css` prop.

This experiment includes enough of Theme UI's components and functionality to enable me to properly evaluate Stitches.
